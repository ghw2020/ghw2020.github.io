# This website is about Agatha Raisin, my favourite PI

Agatha Raisin is a marketing expert from London that moved to the countryside. Here, as here hobby, she is solving murder cases together with here friends. The plot is somehow similar to Agatha Christie`s Mrs Marple, but with a much more current setting, and with more humour.
